# Hangman

> This is a standard hangamn game written compleatley in Python. 

## Milestone 1

- I have created a hangman game that allsows the user to guess a word one letter at a time. The user is informed of how many letters the word has, the are prompted to enter a single letter as their guess and they are then informed if that letter is in the word or if not.

```python
print(f'The mystery word has {len(self.word)} charecters')
print(f'{self.word_guessed}')
```

## Conclusions

- This project challenged my previous knowledge of Python. It allowed me to learn new ways of reaching a goal that way work better. There were many instances where the code was broken and after fixing certain aspects, another part would break or not work. This scenario allowed me to look at how each line interacts with the next and the one before, as well as how the code code works together in its entirety. 
- I found this scenario challenged me in the best way and revealed gaps in my knowledge that can and have been filled.
